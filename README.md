#  ** TESTOVID **
## Testing now on your palms


A web application that predicts whether someone is COVID positive by asking them their symptoms and then asking them to upload a CT scan of their chest. The symptoms are verified by our ML model and if seemed positive the user is asked to take a scan of their lungs and then he's asked to upload the scan. After uploading, our Deep Learning model scans and tests the uploaded image with the previously feeded data.

The website could not be hosted due to some issues.
